//Today I am learning About Data-Types and ECMA 

//tc39 and mdn are the website which are usefull for learning the javascript and ECMA script.

//In javascript there are few datatypes but do all the works. These are the few :

let name = "Rohit"; // String dataType.
let age = 23; // Int or integer dataType.
let active = true; // Boolean dataType.
let h = null; // null is a stand alone value or its defines a variable as "EMPTY".
let state; // undefined is a type where you don't define any value to a variable in js.
let m = Symbol; // symbol is used to define uniquness 

// The above datatypes are know as premitive dataTypes.

// The typeOf is used to define what is the type of a values or a variable.
console.log(typeof "Rohit");
console.log(typeof age);
